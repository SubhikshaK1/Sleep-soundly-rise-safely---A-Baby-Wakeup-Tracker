# Sleep-soundly-rise-safely---A-Baby-Wakeup-Tracker

Situation: Infants under 2 years old are at risk of falling from bed without adult supervision.

Task: Developed a baby monitor system using an IR sensor that detects a baby's awake and movement movements, storing data in ThingSpeak Cloud.

Action: Designed and developed a system using an IR sensor that tracks the baby's movements and stores data in ThingSpeak Cloud. Implemented an automated notification system that calls the parents to alert when the baby wakes up.

Result: The system successfully detected and alerted parents of their baby's wake-up times, providing an added layer of safety and peace of mind for parents.

Key Features:
IR Sensor: Tracks baby's movements and detects when they're awake. (Boolean data type "0 - Woke up. an 1- Sleepling" )
Data Storage: Stores data in ThingSpeak Cloud, allowing for real-time monitoring and analysis.
Parent Notification: Automatically calls to parents when the baby wakes up done using Twilio.

Technical Skills:
Programming languages: Python, C
Development frameworks: Arduino
Cloud integration: ThingSpeak Cloud
